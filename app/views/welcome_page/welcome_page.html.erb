				This site is designed to provide more information about me and my work experience.  One of the methods this site is based on is taking a structured xml document form of my resume and populating a database from its sections.  Web page views are automatically generated based on tables made from that content.  User defined tags and tag categories links are also entered into the records of the site.  Links are automatically generated in descriptions of my experience based on those tags, a parser processes the descriptions and returns text formatted with the links.  A feature of this system is that updated resume content and tags can be submitted at any time and adjustments are automatically made to accommodate the new content.

				Additional technical details include that this web application was designed with Ruby on Rails.  MySql is used for the database and Html5 is the source of the 3d menu above.  A CSS 'nightlight' template from templatemo.com was added for style formatting.  In Ruby, the nokogiri gem is used for xml parsing and a activerecord-import gem is used for efficient processing of database loading.  Github is used for code storage and sharing.  JQuery is utilized in multiple places and a javascript library for rounded edges of rectangle containers from htmlremix.com is included.
