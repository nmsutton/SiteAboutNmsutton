			<Description>Research Assistant at Arizona State University, Pheonix, Az, Java programming using original code, open source programs, and reimplemented programs for a project which researched automatic extraction of text descriptions of gene and drug interactions.  A large science article database was automatically processed to extract and randomly select sentences containing genes and drugs.  Open source modules were integrated including JDom for XML, a database API, and English language processing tools.  The software was optimized for statistical analyses with an open source machine learning tool.  Lead and trained a team of coworkers to generate datasets used in the project, the work was refined over time based on coworker feedback.  The work was published in a science conference at http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W12-2427</Description>
